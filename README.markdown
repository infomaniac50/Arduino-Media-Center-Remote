### Media Center Remote for Arduino

#### Description
This project is a media center remote control. It uses an infrared LED emitter and is connected through the local network using the Arduino ethernet or Arduino + Ethernet Shield. It will eventually be able to control arbitrary devices through a web interface or smartphone. Which of those two will be used or even both is yet to be determined. This is currently an unfinished project so stuff may break, probably quite frequently.

#### FAQ
1. Where did the all repo history go?  
  I started over because the many late night coding sessions where not contributing to the efficacy of the project.

2. Why didn't you do it right in the first place?  
  Because I am a C#/PHP person by nature and I am always learning.

3. Why does this repo need an FAQ?  
  So the complete dump of the repo history doesn't make me feel guilty. For a project on an inherently public service like Github certainly it makes sense to provide such justification. For the most part it is for my own conscience so in my fits of mad genius I don't completely go off the deep end.

4. That last answer was kind of long.  
  Yes it was.
